After a few years of pushing for desegregation of the local Jamaica schools by trying to enroll their children in segregated white institutions - and refusing to send them to segregated Black schools when they were denied admittance - Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco brought suit against the school board of Queens for violating the state’s education law. She and her husband had previously engaged in activism together, but Mr. Cisco passed away in 1897. Mrs. Cisco carried their work forward, alongside her attorneys.[^1]

Neither of the courts that heard the case supported Mrs. Cisco’s claims. They agreed that the school’s principal, on the orders of the district’s superintendent, had prohibited her children’s enrollment in the school closest to their home because it was a segregated white school and the Cisco children were Black, but they did not find this to be a violation of the law, since New York State had a law permitting school segregation. Mrs. Cisco lost her case.

However, by filing the case, Mrs. Cisco had drawn attention to continued legal segregation in New York State - well after New York City’s schools had ended the policy in 1883. New York’s governor Theodore Roosevelt and his allies in the state legislature acted to change the law. The legislature passed and the governor signed a bill, “The Elsberg Bill,” in April 1900 that read “no person shall be refused admission into or be excluded from any public school in the state of New York on account of race or color.[^2]
