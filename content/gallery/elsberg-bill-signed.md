This legislation was regularly referred to as “the Elsberg Bill” because state senator Nathaniel Elsberg introduced the bill. This Brooklyn Daily Eagle story narrates the events leading to the bill’s passage, the differing responses after its signing, and the opinion of Mrs. Cisco’s attorney George Wallace.

The passing of the so-called “Elsberg Bill,” which came as a direct result from the continued activism of Mrs. Cisco and the broad network of Jamaica parents she collaborated with, sought to remove “all distinction of color in admission to public schools of the State of New York.”[^1] This Brooklyn Daily Eagle story narrates the events leading to the bill’s passage, the differing responses to its passage, and the opinion of Mrs. Cisco’s attorney George Wallace.
