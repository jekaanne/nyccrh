Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco worked for more than five years, with her husband and on her own, to push schools in the town of Jamaica, and then the board of education in Queens, and then the New York State Legislature, to end school segregation and provide equal opportunity for her children. A few days after the New York State legislature passed a bill changing the state Constitution to end legal segregation in schools, Mrs. Cisco attended a gathering at a local Black church in the state capital of Albany. The newspaper captured the scene with the small description you see above.

As you read, imagine a sanctuary full of church-goers, most of whom - because the church was part of the African Methodist Episcopal denomination - would have been African American people. They were gathered to celebrate the anniversary of the birth of John Brown, the white abolitionist who led an uprising against slavery in 1859. At this event the congregation was joined by Secretary of State John T. McDonough, who was a white man, and were led by Dr. William H. Johnson, a Black man who was one of the leaders of the church.

As Dr. Johnson mentions the “Elsberg School Bill,” which changed the New York State Constitution to prohibit school districts from operating separate schools for Black and white students, he calls attention to Mrs. Cisco. How does he do so? Is he celebrating her? Belittling her? Both? How do those present respond?
