      <description>Coming Soon The New York City Civil Rights History Project (NYCCRHP) is an in-progress collaborative effort between:
 youth and adult activists, scholars, educators, public history organizations.  The project was inspired by New York City high school student activists who wanted to understand the history of their city and schools. We aim to build a 6-12 grade teaching resource that explores histories of racist and ableist segregation in our schools.</description>

      <description>On October 28, 1958, in two separate cases, the Board of Education charged the Harlem Nine for violating the state’s truancy law. Judge Nathaniel Kaplan, the presiding judge in the first case, found four of the parents guilty of violating the law. Less than two weeks later, Judge Justine Polier, who presided over the second case, dismissed the charges against the parents in her courtroom.
During the trial, the parents explained that they had kept their children out of school because of the unequal conditions.</description>

      <description>During the “Harlem Nine’s” struggle to integrate schools in New York City, multiple newspapers, including the New York Times and Amsterdam News, published photographs of Mae Mallory with her daughter Patricia. These images accompanied articles narrating the legal struggles of Mallory and the other Harlem mothers charged with violating the state’s truancy law. In some ways, she and her daughter became the face of the “Harlem Nine.” While Mae Mallory may have consented to these photos, we might wonder how Patricia felt about her inclusion in the images and how she thought about and felt about the boycott.</description>

      <description>After a few years of pushing for desegregation of the local Jamaica schools by trying to enroll their children in segregated white institutions - and refusing to send them to segregated Black schools when they were denied admittance - Mrs. Elizabeth Cisco brought suit against the school board of Queens for violating the state’s education law. She and her husband had previously engaged in activism together, but Mr. Cisco passed away in 1897.</description>
