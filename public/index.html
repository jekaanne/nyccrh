<p>Histories of oppression, exclusion, segregation, ableism, and racism are often left out of the curriculum. The materials and lessons included here explore these issues in an open and direct way.</p>
<p>Cultural attitudes toward disabled people and language we use to describe disability have evolved. Language to describe communities of color has also evolved over time. On this site, we use the language that communities have chosen to describe themselves today. However, some historical documents included here may include terms that are offensive today. There may also be images and videos that are emotionally upsetting. We have chosen to include a warning for materials that are more upsetting. For educators, we ask that you acknowledge these difficulties and make space for emotional responses that they may provoke. For students using these materials, we ask that you consider how you and your peers&rsquo; identity as a disabled or nondisabled persons, and you and your peers’ racial identities, may change your emotional reaction to these materials.</p>
<p>For educators using these materials, we ask that you plan intentionally to use them with care. When discussing any new or sensitive topic, there is the potential for some students to react in stereotypical or disrespectful ways. It is therefore imperative that educators carefully review the lesson, assess students’ maturity and readiness to engage in the lesson prior to implementation, and establish clear parameters with students that will ensure safe and constructive dialogue. Please see the relevant resources here:  &ldquo;Teaching Hard History&rdquo;; &ldquo;Facing History and Ourselves&rdquo;; “Establishing a Safe Learning Environment”; “Creating an Anti-Bias Learning Environment”</p>
